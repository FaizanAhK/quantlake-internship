# QuantLake Internship Progress Report

### Day 1


- Python/Jupyter Notebook already installed
- Understood Git and GitHub basics
- Created Github repo named 'quantlake-internship' with folders named 'trainings' and 'projects'.
- Inside training folder, created a python notebook named "day1_python_basics" and filled with instructions.


#### Progress Log

- I chose Jupyter Notebook for Python.
- Python and Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook already installed, no configuration as of now.
- I learnt about everyday workflow that happens in industries.
- Python basics
- Learned Git and GitHub
- The internship repo is live and well structured. 


### Day 2

#### Progress Log

- Practiced working with list, set, tuple, dict
   - Praciced List Comprehensions
   - Dictionary nesting and lookup
   - Functions and Modules like math,random, datetime
   - Learnt try, except, finally in python

- Prime Number felt hardest and factorial was the easiest

- Screenhot of the problem solved : List Sorting and Duplicate Removal

### Day 3

#### Progress Log

##### Dataset Used : Titanic Dataset
##### Features Explored : Size & Shape of the Dataset, added and dropped columns etc.
##### 



## Day 4 Summary

- Practiced .loc and .iloc for slicing
- Cleaned missing data with dropna() and fillna()
- Grouped sales data by Region and Category
- Merged sample customer-order datasets using different join types


## Day 5 - Data Manipulation II

**Dataset Used**: Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)

### Reshaping Methods Practiced:
- `df.pivot(index, columns, values)` to reshape sales by Region and Category
- `df.pivot_table()` to calculate average profit per Segment
- `df.melt()` to convert wide format to long format for Category/Sub-Category

### Transformation Logic Implemented:
- Used `.apply()` with custom function to classify Profit as High/Medium/Low
- Flagged rows with discount > 90%
- Used `.map()` to convert Region to Region Code
- Replaced "Consumer" with "Retail" in Segment column

### DataFrame Combinations:
- Concatenated two DataFrames vertically with `ignore_index=True`
- Combined DataFrames with mismatched columns using `axis=1`

### Challenges & Workarounds:
- Dropped missing values before applying pivot
- Ensured consistent column formats before using `map()` and `replace()`

**Final Dashboard**: Pivot table showing Profit by Category and Region
